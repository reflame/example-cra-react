An example of a Reflame React app with Create React App.

Using Reflame and CRA together in the same codebase this way allows you to try out Reflame on a CRA project with 0 risk (but with [some](https://github.com/reflame/example-cra-react/pull/2/commits/49eee1bbf9c423c15f8e5f2b457b6ae7cebc8373) [limitations](https://github.com/reflame/example-cra-react/pull/2/commits/4393398429f762975030386c51b5ef123b895329) compared to using CRA or Reflame alone). 

Continue to deploy previews and production using CRA with an existing deployment service you're familiar with, while enjoying Reflame's instant previews. Only switch over production deployments once Reflame has earned your trust for instant production deploys as well.

Even after you've fully migrated to Reflame, you can continue to use CRA as an offline-capable backup to the [Reflame VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=reflame.agent). The extension deploys to the internet on every save using Live Previews, which requires internet access. In exchange, it also enables seamless cross-device sharing, and full production parity on every save.
